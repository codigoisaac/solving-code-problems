# Examples of how to run solutions for each language

## Run `JavaScript` solutions:

```
$ node ./001_Detecting_Permutations/solution.js
```

## Run `TypeScript` solutions:

```
$ npx ts-node ./001_Detecting_Permutations/
solution.ts
```

# Notes

For each exercise, only one of the solutions, in only one of the programming languages, will have comments explaining the solution approach.

The programming language chosen to have the explanatory comments may vary from exercise to exercise. In one exercise, the C# solution may contain the explanatory comments, and in another exercise the comments may be in the Python solution.

I opted for this approach because the goal is to practice programming in multiple languages, and not to duplicate the same comments in all of them.
