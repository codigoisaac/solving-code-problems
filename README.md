# Solving Code Problems

This is a project I use to practice solving algorithm problems with multiple programming languages.

For each problem, I have one solution in each of the following programming languages:

- Python
- TypeScript
- JavaScript
- C# (coming soon)
- Java (coming soon)
- Go (coming soon)

## Why?

I work on this project for three reasons:

1. As a nerdy way to pass the time. I have other serious and important projects, and when I want to program just to relax and distract my mind a bit from those other projects, I come here to solve some algorithms. It's good for the mind.

2. Also, to get better at solving logic problems with algorithms and at the same time sharpen my skills in multiple programming languages. This type of problem comes up quite often in technical interviews, so it's a very useful exercise to do.

3. In addition, when you've already solved a problem in language A, solving the same problem in language B becomes easier, freeing you to focus on the syntax of the language and become more familiar with it, since the logic has already been solved by you in another language.

In short: to pass the time and relax, to improve my skills in logic and algorithms, and to become proficient in various programming languages.

## Examples of how to run solutions for each language

### Run `JavaScript` solutions:

```
$ node ./001_Detecting_Permutations/solution.js
```

### Run `TypeScript` solutions:

```
$ npx ts-node ./001_Detecting_Permutations/solution.ts
```

### Run `Python` solutions:

```
$ python3 ./001_Detecting_Permutations/solution.py
```

## Notes

For each exercise, only one of the solutions, in only one of the programming languages, will have comments explaining the solution approach.

The programming language chosen to have the explanatory comments may vary from exercise to exercise. In one exercise, the C# solution may contain the explanatory comments, and in another exercise the comments may be in the Python solution.

I opted for this approach because the goal here is to practice programming in multiple languages, and not to duplicate the same comments in all of them.
